I have tried to get as far as I could on my own and a bit of research. I have tried to reseach the issue of having to not allow the append to stack the gifs. I have looked up the .html, .empty and . clear to see if it could work and see what orders it could be done. The search bar was challenging for me. I understand that my assignment is late but I would like to see how far I could see if I could get as far as I can let alone this is most likely considered very basic that I should know. I apolgize for the lack of assignments being turned in.
